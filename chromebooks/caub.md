# CAUB - Chrome Auto Update Blocker
#### Discovered by Catakang#0987
This exploit keeps your chromebook downgraded (or on the current version) without automatic updates screwing you over.

1. Go to `chrome://network#state` (on your school chromebook of course; if this is blocked then ur kinda screwed lol).
2. Scroll to the bottom of the page; you should see a list of "favorite" wifis that you've connected to in the past.
3. Click the + sign next to the wifi name of each network that you commonly connect your chromebook to.
4. The more wifis you expand, the better, but note that they have to come from the "favorites" section.
5. Use ctrl+a and ctrl+c to copy all the text on the entire network#state page.
6. Go to [caub.glitch.me](https://caub.glitch.me/)/[caub4evry1.glitch.me](https://caub4evry1.glitch.me/).
7. Paste the copied text into the textbox below.
8. Press the "generate onc" button below the textbox.
9. Once you have downloaded the file, go to `chrome://network#general`
10. Click on the "import onc" button
11. Import the newly downloaded file

**Extra notes**
- Your chromebook will no longer automatically update, as long as you are on a wifi that you used CAUB on.
- Be careful not to stay on a WIFI connection for too long without using CAUB on it, otherwise you might update.
- This may not work in future updates, or on all WIFI connectiosn
