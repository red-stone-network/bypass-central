# DOWNGRADE CHROME OS
Downgrading can be used for several exploits, to get to a version that doesn't have patches for certain exploits, sutch as LTBEEF. 
This is a built in feature of ChromeOS.

You'll need a USB thumb drive with at least 4GB of storage, some board have small or bigger images, so have a beef usb, I recommend 16gb
and a personal computer with access to downloading extentions

1. Navigate to chrome://version on the chromebook you with to downgrade and check for your board under "Platform" 
(it's the text after stable-channel)
